# Movement Report Organizer

## Overview

At Lee's Marketplace, Department Managers can get movement reports for their product. 
This can come in a csv file, but contains alot of columns that are not useful.
This program is initially intended to get rid of those useless lines so that one does not
have to waste time opening the file, deciphering which columns are important, then deleting
them. 

## Objectives
* Using the command line will select which file will be edited using the program. 
* Program will open up csv file, and edit the file/ create a new file that keeps the essential 
information needed. 
## Expected Output
The expected output will be a file that is smaller than the original file, which contains the
needed columns of a movement report.
